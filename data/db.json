And when I saw her in the uniform for the first time my eyes began to brim with tears. Those clothes represent the beginning of her long school journey. One that’s filled with new friends, new experiences, and so much independence. ",

She was confident after her balance bike, so she only had them on the first day. I  took them off because She is a good rider. Then she went on the bike and in few minutes she was totally on her own!",

Before I had my baby, I don’t think I’d considered exactly how big of a deal her first car ride would be.",
